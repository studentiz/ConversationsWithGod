## 🚀 Getting Started

No installation required!

1. Visit [https://studentiz.github.io/ConversationsWithGod/](https://studentiz.github.io/ConversationsWithGod/)
2. Start your conversation
3. Alternate between you (the seeker/student) and your inner wisdom (God)

Or download the HTML file and open it locally in any browser.

## 🪞 A Mirror for Your Soul

ConversationsWithGod is a simple but profound tool for having meaningful conversations with yourself. Frame your thoughts as a dialogue between a seeker and the divine – or however you choose to imagine your higher self.

Unlike traditional journal apps or AI chatbots, this is a space for genuine self-reflection. You play both parts in the conversation, allowing your own wisdom to emerge through the dialogue.

## 💭 Why This Exists

> "Know thyself." — Ancient Greek aphorism

We all need space to process our thoughts, ask deep questions, and listen to our inner wisdom. This tool provides a structured way to externalize that internal dialogue, making it easier to explore your own beliefs, challenges, and insights.

## 🔒 Privacy & Your Data

Your conversations are stored only on your device using browser localStorage. Nothing is ever sent to a server. There are no analytics, no tracking, and no cookies. Your thoughts remain entirely your own.

1. **🙋 Start a dialogue**: Type your question or thought as yourself
2. **💫 Respond as wisdom**: The next message automatically switches roles
3. **🔄 Continue the conversation**: Alternate between the two perspectives
4. **⚙️ Adjust settings**: Change font size or toggle dark mode as needed
5. **📤 Export when ready**: Save your conversations for reference or training

## 🕊️ The Philosophy Behind It

> "The kingdom of God is within you." — Luke 17:21

This tool is built on the belief that we all have access to profound wisdom within ourselves. By creating space for dialogue, we can access parts of our consciousness that often go unheard in the noise of everyday thinking.

Whether you see this higher wisdom as God, your higher self, universal consciousness, or simply your own deeper insight doesn't matter. What matters is creating the space to listen.
